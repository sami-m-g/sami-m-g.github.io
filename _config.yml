story: >
  I’m Mina, a product-minded engineer who lives at the intersection of technology,
  design, and strategy. I graduated from Computer Engineering at Cairo University,
  where I later returned as a teaching assistant. I strengthened my technical background
  through Google Summer of Code and Facebook’s Deep Learning scholarship.

  I began my career at Procter & Gamble, leading a cross functional team to help build the
  company’s global data lake. We received the CTO’s Best Technical Team Award
  and created tens of millions of dollars in business value.
  
  Wanting to work closer to user experience inside a global tech environment, I joined Microsoft.
  I contributed across product, engineering, analytics, and product design. At Microsoft SwiftKey
  iOS, I owned key parts of the product strategy and design system, using Figma to create flows,
  prototypes, and UX improvements. The features I helped ship contributed to tripling daily
  active users and strengthening SwiftKey’s position in the Microsoft ecosystem. I also worked
  on Microsoft Clarity, where I delivered highly requested analytics features that now serve 
  hundreds of thousands of users every day.
  
  Alongside my full time roles, I never stopped building. As a freelance Product Engineer, I
  love creating software from scratch and seeing it reach tens of thousands of people. I move
  comfortably between coding, design, PRDs, and go to market work because each part teaches me
  something different about how products come to life. I also spend time coaching new product
  managers, helping them grow their confidence, build their skills, and find their place in the
  field.

  Outside of work, I spend most of my time doing the things that keep me inspired. I play guitar
  and saxophone, cook a lot, and work out regularly. I also love traveling and exploring new
  places, cultures, and experiences.
